    "The normal distribution is a probability distribution that is commonly used as a statistical model in many fields, including finance, engineering, social sciences, \n",
    "and natural sciences. The normal distribution is a bell-shaped curve that is \n",
    "characterized by its mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ), and \n",
    "it is often used to model random variables that are continuous and \n",
    "have a symmetric distribution around the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "The normal distribution is a useful model for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "Many natural and social phenomena can be reasonably modeled using the normal distribution. \n",
    "For example, the heights of adult humans, the weights of apples in a basket, and the errors \n",
    "in a manufacturing process can often be modeled using the normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The normal distribution is easy to work with mathematically, which makes it a useful tool \n",
    "for statistical analysis and modeling. Many statistical methods and tests assume that the \n",
    "data is normally distributed, which allows for more accurate and reliable results.\n",
    "\n",
    "The normal distribution has several important properties, such as the central limit theorem, \n",
    "which states that the sum of a large number of independent random variables will tend to follow \n",
    "a normal distribution, regardless of their underlying distributions. This makes\n",
    "the normal distribution a useful tool for modeling complex systems and processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the normal distribution is a powerful tool for modeling and analyzing data in\n",
    "many fields, and its properties make it a useful model for a wide range of applications."
