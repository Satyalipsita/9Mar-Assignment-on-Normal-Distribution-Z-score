    "In statistics, a z-score (or standard score) is a measure of how many\n",
    "standard deviations a given data point is away from the mean of the dataset.\n",
    "The z-score is calculated by subtracting the mean from the data point and \n",
    "dividing the result by the standard deviation. \n",
    "The resulting value is a standardized score that can be used to compare data points \n",
    "from different datasets that have different means and standard deviations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The importance of z-scores lies in their ability \n",
    "to standardize data and make it easier to compare and analyze. Some common uses of z-scores include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Identifying outliers: Z-scores can be used to identify data points that are significantly \n",
    "different from the rest of the dataset. Typically, any data point with a z-score greater \n",
    "than 3 or less than -3 is considered an outlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis testing: Z-scores are often used in hypothesis testing to determine whether a\n",
    "given data point or set of data points is significantly different from the expected values. \n",
    "By comparing the z-score to a standard normal distribution, it is possible to calculate the \n",
    "probability (p-value) of observing a data point as extreme as the one in question.\n",
    "\n",
    "Standardization: Z-scores are used to standardize data by transforming it into a \n",
    "standardized scale with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This makes it \n",
    "easier to compare data points from different datasets, as they are all on the same scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data analysis: Z-scores can be used to compare different variables in a dataset \n",
    "that have different units of measurement. By standardizing the data using z-scores,\n",
    "it is possible to compare variables on the same scale and identify any correlations \n",
    "or relationships between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, z-scores are an important statistical tool\n",
    "that can be used to standardize data and make it easier to\n",
    "analyze and compare. They are widely used in many fields,\n",
    "including finance, engineering, and social sciences, and are an\n",
    "essential part of modern statistical analysis."
